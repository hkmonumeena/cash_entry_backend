        <h1>Privacy Policy for Cash Entry</h1>
        <p>
            At Cash Entry, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our app.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Cash Entry uses Google email authentication to verify your identity. This is the only personal information we collect from you. We do not store or share your email address with any third parties. The email is used solely for authentication purposes and is not shared with anyone outside the app.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security and Protection</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal data. All data transmitted through Cash Entry, including your email address, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. This means your data is converted into a secure format that cannot be read by unauthorized parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            We employ a range of security measures, including secure network protocols, encryption, and access control mechanisms to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. We also regularly review our security practices to ensure the highest level of data protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your data is stored securely and is only accessible to authorized personnel who are required to keep the information confidential. We do not share, sell, or lease your personal data to any third parties under any circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Encryption</h2>
        <p>
            All personal information collected by Cash Entry is encrypted both in transit and at rest. This ensures that your data is protected from interception or unauthorized access while being transmitted over the internet or stored on our servers. The encryption process makes your data unreadable to anyone who does not have the necessary authorization to access it.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Cash Entry does not use or integrate with any third-party services or tools that collect or process your personal data, other than Googleâ€™s secure authentication system.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
